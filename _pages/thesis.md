## Abstract

My doctoral thesis explores combining electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and machine learning to monitor pump operation and reduce energy consumption. By reconstructing internal states with EIT and training data-driven models to detect anomalies and suggest energy-saving control actions, the project delivers a pipeline from sensing to actionable control.

## Methods & contributions

- Data collection and EIT reconstruction for transient flow inside pumping systems
- Novel ML pipelines for real-time anomaly detection and condition-based optimization
- Integration of control-theoretic objectives with learning algorithms for operational efficiency
